This code has a dependency on jQuery and jQuery UI

This code is for a marquee widget that allows text to come from any of four directions, with any of the easing effects supported by jQuery UI.  See http://jsfiddle.net/phhht/MtxC5/2/ for sample usage (push the run button).

I wrote this initially for use in a Windows 8 javascript app, though I know it works across the latest versions of IE, Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Safari.  I have not tested it across various versions of IE.
